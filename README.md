# Brave SwapAn open-source swap interface by Brave, focussed on usability and multi-chainsupport.## Project structure```├── interface│├── sites│   ├── mock│   ├── bravedotcom```The project consists of three top-level directories:1. `interface` ⮕ library implementing the UI, and swap hooks.2. `sites` ⮕ full-blown applications that use the `interface` library.# DevelopmentSince `interface` is a library, it cannot be run as a standalone application.We have therefore created a `sites/mock` application that can be used for localdevelopment. Please follow these instructions to setup a development environmentwith hot reloading. ```shell$ cd swap/interface$ npm install$ npm run dev```In another tab:```shell$ cd swap/sites/mock$ npm install$ npm start```
